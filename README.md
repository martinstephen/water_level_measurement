<h1>water_level_measurement</h1>
Measures the amount of water in the AC overflow bottle

<h2>Goals</h2>
Create a system to measure the amount of water in the AC overflow bottles<br>
There are 2 bottles , one in the sitting room , one in the bedroom - 8 litres each.<br>
The weight of the bottle will be measured with 2 loadcell connected to microcontrollers.(MVP1)<br>
The microcontrollers will share the data to an Alexa.<br>
Alexa will output the current level of water and predict when the water will overflow.<br>

There will be a small python powered display ,showing the data(MVP3)<br>

<h2>TODO</h2>
select 2 microcontrollers (arduino/cortex m4)<br>
select the loadcells<br>
Program the UC to work with the loadcells<br>
