# water_level_measurement
Measures the amount of water in the AC overflow bottle

#Goals
Create a system to measure the amount of water in the AC overflow bottles
There are 2 bottles , one in the sitting room , one in the bedroom - 8 litres each.
The weight of the bottle will be measured with 2 loadcell connected to microcontrollers.(MVP1)
The microcontrollers will share the data to an Alexa.
Alexa will output the current level of water and predict when the water will overflow.

There will be a small python powered display ,showing the data(MVP3)

#TODO
select 2 microcontrollers (arduino/cortex m4)
select the loadcells
Program the UC to work with the loadcells
